# INTRO-TO-HTML-CSS
Today, I am thrilled to present a comprehensive report on my journey through "HTML & CSS 101: Introduction to HTML." Over the past few years, I have delved into the core concepts that form the backbone of web development. From understanding the fundamental structure of HTML documents to exploring text formatting, capabilities, and the critical aspect of navigation and linking, I've covered a wide spectrum of topics.
My aim has been to equip myself with the foundational knowledge required to create robust, well-structured, and visually appealing web pages. Through a series of activities and hands-on examples, I have not only delved into the theoretical aspects but also applied my understanding to practical scenarios.
In this report, I will revisit each section, examining the key takeaways and showcasing examples that highlight the effectiveness of my learning activities. Together, I'll reflect on the progress made and lay the groundwork for my continued exploration into the realm of HTML and CSS.
So, without further ado, let's embark on this journey through HTML & CSS 101 and celebrate the milestones I've achieved!

**HTML & CSS 101: Introduction to HTML**

**1. Introduction to HTML**
Completed: This section covers the fundamental concepts of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), providing an overview of its purpose and structure. It likely included information on tags, elements, and the basic anatomy of an HTML document.
The introduction to HTML covered the basic structure of HTML documents, emphasizing the use of tags to define elements. Examples included the <html>, <head>, and <body> tags. The concept of attributes was introduced, illustrating how they enhance tag functionality.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>

**2. HTML Text Formatting**
Completed: This module focuses on the various ways HTML allows for text formatting. This could include discussions on headings, paragraphs, emphasis (bold and italic), lists, and other text-related tags. Understanding these elements is crucial for creating well-structured and visually appealing content.
This section delved into text formatting options within HTML. Examples included the use of tags such as <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <em>, <strong>, <u>, and <br>. These tags demonstrated how to structure and stylize text content.
<p>This is a <em>paragraph</em> with emphasized text and <strong>strongly emphasized</strong> words. </p>
<p>Another line with an <u>underlined</u> word and a line break here:<br>Line after line break.</p>

**3. HTML Capabilities**
Completed: This part of the course likely delves deeper into HTML's capabilities, covering topics such as forms, multimedia embedding (images, audio, video), and perhaps touch upon the use of attributes to enhance HTML elements. Understanding these capabilities is essential for creating interactive and feature-rich web pages.
HTML capabilities were explored, including the integration of images with the <img> tag, lists using <ul> and <ol>, and tables with <table>, <tr>, <th>, and <td> tags. Additionally, multimedia embedding with <audio> and <video> tags was covered. Practical examples illustrated how to incorporate these elements into web pages.
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Header 1</th>
        <th>Header 2</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Data 1</td>
        <td>Data 2</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<audio controls>
    <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
</audio>

**4. HTML Navigation and Linking**
Completed: HTML Navigation and Linking, crucial components of web development. It covers the basics of HTML structure, the use of the <a> tag for creating links, understanding absolute and relative paths, linking to external resources, navigating within the same page, creating navigation menus, and linking to email addresses and phone numbers. Mastering these fundamental concepts is essential for building well-structured and user-friendly websites, providing a foundation for effective web development and user interaction.
